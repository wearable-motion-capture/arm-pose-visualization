# Arm Pose Visualization

This repository is part of the [wearable motion capture](https://github.com/wearable-motion-capture) framework and 
provides code to visualize the arm pose estimates from smartwatch and smartphone sensor data on a 3D avatar. It opens network sockets to receive 
arm pose estimates from our **Arm Pose Estimation** module.
